  "Spend your money on the things money can buy. Spend your time on the things money can't buy" - Haruki Murakami

Hi there! My name is Kien Nguyen, and I am a computer science junior at Iowa State University, graduating in May 2016.

I like solving complex problem, thinking logically and being smart. I love experimenting new backend frameworks, trying out new programming languages and tangling with CSS tricks.

When I am not messing around with code or math, I usually spend time playing badminton, watching soccer, listening to music or reading book.
