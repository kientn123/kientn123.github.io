title: Sophomore Year - The year of perspective changing
---

As a child grown up in a developing Asian country, where the society's definition of success is having the best grade in school, I have always been forced by my parents and myself to study really hard to be one of the best students in any school I attended. Most of the time I spent in my childhood was on studying and mastering all the subjects that school required. Extracurricular activities for me were really rare, and having time discovering something new outside of school didn't exist on my schedule. Having a 4.0 GPA at the best schools in the country is the top priority for me, my parents and the society.

With that in mind, I came to the United States striving to be a *GPA scorer* at school. And of course, I spent my first year in college just studying classes in school and ended both semesters with a beautiful 4.0 on my transcript, not realizing how many opportunities I had missed.

The first event that blew my mind was when I attended the [StartUp Weekend - Des Moines](http://dsm.startupweekend.org/) in the first semester in my second year. There were around 100 people attending that event. Some people pitched their ideas, and the rest of us voted for the best ones to work on.
